# Random Graph Generator
This Python script generates a random graph with nodes and links between them. The graph can be visualized using Tkinter. The script allows users to add nodes, clear the graph, perform a breadth-first search traversal, print the adjacency matrix, and animate the breadth-first search traversal.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Install the required packages:
`pip install tkinter`
3. Run the script:
`python random_graph_generator.py`

# How to Use
1. Add nodes to the graph by specifying the number of nodes to add using the numeric up-down control and clicking the "add" button.
2. Clear the graph by clicking the "clear" button.
3. Perform a breadth-first search traversal by clicking the "Breadth-first search" button. The result will be displayed in the label below the button.
4. Print the adjacency matrix by clicking the "print adjacency matrix" button.
5. Animate the breadth-first search traversal by clicking the "animate" button.

# Dependencies
